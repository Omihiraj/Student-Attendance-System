# Student-Attendance-System
This is a Student Fingerprint System for Sri Lanka Universities.
I used Arduino Board.
I used c++,php,html,css,js for develop this project.
__________________________________________________
I developed this to provide a solution to a problem that exists in Sri Lanka public universities. That is the lack of a good way for children to watch the Mahapola and Bursuri allowances properly.
This calculates their attendance percentage and shows whether they are entitled to Barisri or Mahapola for that month.
